What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

     Git creates the .git hidden folder to store committed files. 
     It also inicates to git that is a repository.
     You need to intialize the repository so that you can use git against the files
     within it. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
     Files in the working directory may or may not be be tracked. All files within
     the staging area tracked, but not committed. Files in the repository are files
     from the staging area that have been committed. 
What value do you think it offers?
     It allows tracking of only the relevant files from the working directory. 
     Image files and other non-changing files do not need to be staged .
